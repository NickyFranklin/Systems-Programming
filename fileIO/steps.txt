1. Make a program called copy.c that takes in 3 arguments: infile outfile blocksize
Make error messages for not having enough arguments
If the blocksize argument is skipped, assume a size of 1024
If a block size is not a multiple of 4, print to stderror and round up to nearest 4 bytes

2. open a file using the open system call and write the contents to an array, verify that the values are correct
The array will be unsigned ints

3. Open another file and write the contents of the array to the file, verify that the values are correct

4. Take four bytes of the array and Xor it with that same block summed togethe

5. Edit the program so that the files are being read and written to one block at a time
